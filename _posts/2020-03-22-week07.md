title: Week 7 - Social Distancing
---


I guess the most prominent thing to write about these past 2 weeks is the whole epidemic stuff going on, and how it has changed class a bit. I thought the first remote class went as well as I could have hoped, although it might end up being tough getting together now in groups to work on our open source project without getting too sidetracked with everything else going on. Meanwhile though, I have been able to make my first myriad contributions to Wikipedia, and it ended up being more fun than I thought to try and fix all of the different small errors and typos and such that exist in the site's many pages. It feels like I'm not doing a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, but I guess that any bit helps and somebody has got to add that missing closing parentheses! I'll be curious to see how the class progresses from here with the rest of the semester being remote, hoping everything can clear up soon!
