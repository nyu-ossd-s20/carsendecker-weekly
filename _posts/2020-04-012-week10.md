title: Week 10 - Project Work
---


This week, we got to work in more earnest on our final projects. I am now feeling pretty confident about how my group and I are doing, and the project that we are working on. I've used Inky in the past for some projects and thought that it has great potential, but it had some annoying bugs. Hopefully now I can help fix some!

Our first conversations with the community went well, and were able to help me fix a bug while installing within a day. I posted an issue about it, and that was also replied to quickly and created a short discussion, but was also recently closed due to my error being a very niche one that not many had ever seen before (oof). They were courteous in discussion though, and closed my issue quickly and gracefully. We'll be looking on more code contributions next, and maybe some documentation!
