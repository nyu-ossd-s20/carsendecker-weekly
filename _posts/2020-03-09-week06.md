title: Week 5 - The First Correctly Dated Post File
---


Wouldn't you know, it's not 2019 anymore even though my post file names seem to think so. I enjoyed the guest speaker once again, and am glad that she came back to speak a little bit more in depth on what she does since she can see things more from a student's perspective. Her take on websites like Github and the different alternatives was pretty interesting, and made me consider the advantages and disadvantages of using an open source site like GitLab vs a corporate one like Github. Hopefully Github doesn't decide to disappear anytime soon, but at least they have the data backed up in the Arctic somewhere! (joke btw)

Looking at projects to evaluate and potentially work on is more difficult than expected to be honest. It seems like there is always something about a project that is missing/not fleshed out enough, and I will be waiting patiently for the day there is the "perfect" open source project to trump all open source projects, with active members, commented code, good documentation, and easy installation instructions! But for now, I have been mainly looking at things that seem interesting and are hopefully not a nightmare to work with.
