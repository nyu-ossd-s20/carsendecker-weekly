title: Week 9 - Gil Yehuda
---



This week, we discussed a bit about The Cathedral and the Bazaar, as well as had Gil Yehuda come to speak about his own experience as a part of Verizon Media. First of all, I found our talk about the Cathedral and the Bazaar to be pretty interesting, and honestly got a lot more active class discussion than I thought! It's cool to see how varied, and even divisive, the views could be on these simple bullet point style claims that the author makes.


Otherwise, I also enjoyed Gil's talk with us, as it was yet another more in depth look on the professional world of open source. He also took the time to touch upon jobs and how they look for candidates and such, which I appreciated! One small but funny thing that I took away from the talk that was that threatening to make a project open source suddenly made the devs want to improve it and make everything coded nicely. It seemed pretty relatable, even in the context of other fields, that you want your work to look good when it is public. This feeling also likely ends up making open source projects (sometimes) cleaner due to all the public code.
