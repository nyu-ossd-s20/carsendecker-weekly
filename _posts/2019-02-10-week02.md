title: Week 2 - Creating an Extension
---


For our browser extension, we have come up with a simple program that converts certain animal words into images on a webpage. Our process has been a little slow as we have spent time brainstorming exactly what we wanted to do. I believe not all of us are epxerienced with javascript so we wanted an idea that was kinda fun but not too intensive code-wise. I have been working on adding the initial files and folders needed for the extension, and will be starting to work on the initial code as well. I have definitely learned a good amount about how an extension works in general, and even how much easier it is to make a simple extension than it seems on the surface.
