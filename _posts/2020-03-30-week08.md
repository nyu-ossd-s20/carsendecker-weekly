title: Week 8 - Rebasing
---


It feels like whenever you feel like you have the hang of using git, you end up learning a new feature that can completely change the way you might use it! While rebasing definitely seems like an integral and more basic function of git, I have never really come across or had to use it for anything that I have worked on so far. Granted, this seems like its most important for projects with very large teams, or something like fast moving open source projects where you are working on your own fork of something and want to not mess up the history of commits with your pull request of a branch that began 5 master versions ago. Either way, this seems like we will for sure need to get comfortable with performing rebases for our main project contributions for this class.

For my project itself, my group and I have tentatively decided a new program to work on, and have already got in contact with some members of the community! They seem very friendly and helpful, and surprisingly active given that the project itself on github seems slow-moving. We're feeling confident though since they seem welcoming and willing to give pointers on what newbies could work on.
