title: Week 13 - Final Project Work
---

This week was mainly all about final projects. Not too much to say that I haven't covered in previous blog posts, to be honest. Although for our standup on Monday I thought it went pretty well, and I feel good with where we are at with our project. We all had something to say in terms of our own interactions and contributions, and I think we are on track for where we are supposed to be. There have been a few missteps in terms of getting certain things pull requested, such as some features not being deemed priority for their next release, or even one contributor actually finishing the feature we were working on first!

I will also touch on the fact that although it's a bit disappointing that we were not able to have our class on bash commands, as it is always fun to learn some more command line wizardry, I do hope that the family health concerns have passed! Wishing all the best as things are of course very crazy still. Looking forward as well to hearing others' final project presentations.
